# The Ghosts
The Ghosts is an immersive campaign focussed around an elite company of US soldiers who are deployed as the vanguard force into a theatre of conflict.
These soldiers are skilled in covert warfare focussing on Recon, Demolitions, SAR (Search and Rescue) and COIN (Counter Insurgency and Narcotics) operations.

## Project Vision
To develop a challenging and immersive campaign using the Arma 3 engine and assets to recreate a tactical experience that draws inspiration from the golden era of tactical shooters in the early 2000s.
Along with the campaign the project will develop assets and functionality that will allow the community to extend the addon, allow the creation of missions.

## Motivation

First person shooters have been around now for more than 25 years (can you believe it?). In this time we have seen many spin-offs and niches developed.
One style that had a lasting effect on me was the [Tactical Shooter] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_shooter "Tactical Shooter").
Sadly over the years this style of FPS has been neglected and cast to the sidelines where it has been kept alive by MilSim companies
but without that reach that it had before.
I want to capture the essence of what the tactical shooters were providing and repackage it for people to enjoy again.

## Unit Classes and Kit
* **Rifleman**: the main unit that comprises all squads. Standard issue US weapons will include M4A1, M16A2 w/ M203, M67 Frags, M9 or MK23 pistols.
* **Automatic Rifleman**: used for suppression to allow squads to fire and manoeuvre. Standard and non-standard ARs will include M249, M240, MG36.
* **Support**: will provide ammunition, medical and technical support to a Ghost squad. Will be equipped with a carbine or PDW (personal defence weapon) such as M4A1, H&K MP5a2
* **Marksman**: the designated marksman will be attached to squads to provide accurate suppression fire. Weapons used will include M14 rifle and M16.
* **Sniper**: functioning as a single unit, the sniper can manoeuvre with or without other Ghost squads to provide recon or support. They utilise the M24 or M110 rifle to take out targets at a distance.
* **Demolitions**: carrying the heavy weapons when needed. The demolitions unit can utilise explosives or anti-tank launchers to get the job done. The M2 Slam or Satchel charge is used for demolishing targets and the AT4 launcher for destroying soft to medium armoured targets.

Standard issue Army Woodland or Desert BDUs are still being used by the Ghosts instead of the modern MTP or ACU patterns.
