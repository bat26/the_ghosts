# The Ghosts

ArmA 3 addon that provides an immersive campaign focused around an elite company of soldiers
who are the vanguard force in a theater of conflict.


## Vision

* To develop a believable and replayable campaign for ArmA 3 that draws inspiration from the hallmarks of tactical shoots from the early 2000s
* Provide a basic SDK for other content creators to developer and share similarly themed operations and campaigns
* Develop assets to improve the immersion of the campaign

## Motivation

First person shooters have been around now for more than 25 years (can you believe it?). In this time we have seen many nices for this genres.
One style that had a lasting effect on me was the [Tactical Shooter] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_shooter "Tactical Shooter").
Sadly over the years this style of FPS has been neglected and cast to the sidelines where it has been kept alive by MilSim companies
but without that reach that it had before.
I want to capture the essence of what the tactical shooters were providing and repackage it for people to enjoy again.

## Get with the times old man!
