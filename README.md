# The Ghosts

ArmA 3 addon that provides an immersive campaign focused around an elite company of soldiers
who are the vanguard force in a theater of conflict.

## Vision

To develop a believable and re-playable campaign for ArmA 3 that draws inspiration from the hallmarks of tactical shoots from the early 2000s.
Accompanying the campaign will be assets for community to extend and run their own missions allowing re-playability.

## Motivation

First person shooters have been around now for more than 25 years (can you believe it?). In this time we have seen many spin-offs and niches developed.
One style that had a lasting effect on me was the [Tactical Shooter] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_shooter "Tactical Shooter").
Sadly over the years this style of FPS has been neglected and cast to the sidelines where it has been kept alive by MilSim companies
but without that reach that it had before.
I want to capture the essence of what the tactical shooters were providing and repackage it for people to enjoy again.

## Goals

* Develop campaign assets including textures, sounds and scripts.
* Develop a UI for briefing, roster and kit loadout.
* Create campaign template to speed the development of missions.
* Stats and roster persistency.
* Initial feedback from community and improvements.
* Ability to integrate other ArmA 3 mods easily.

## Support

Support will be available through an installation guide. TBD
